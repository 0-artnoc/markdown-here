      <strong>Until now, formatting your email has been a hassle.</strong> If you're writing an email of any length and complexity, you've found yourself constantly fiddling around: selecting text, clicking formatting buttons, and then fiddling some more to get it right. This is tedious, frustrating, and slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Markdown Here</b> allows you to <strong>write complex email in simple text</strong>, never taking your hands off the keyboard. When you're finished, <strong>just one click</strong> of your mouse will make your email <strong>ready to send</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You write you email in something called "Markdown", which is... <strong>so simple</strong> that it's almost not worth describing. If you've ever used <strong>asterisks and dashes and spaces</strong> to add emphasis and structure when you write, then <strong>you already use it</strong>.

Markdown
--------

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
  - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!

      Still not convinced that Markdown Here is for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown Here has some <strong>extra special powers</strong> that help you to do things that are almost impossible in ordinary email editors. For example, it lets you put <strong>tables</strong>, <strong>source code</strong> snippets, and even <strong>mathematical formulae</strong> in your email. Take a look at the <strong>example below</strong>, and try it yourself.

There are **multiple syntax highlighting themes** to choose from. Here's one of them:

```javascript
// All the code you will ever need
var hw = "Hello World!"
alert(hw);
```

My math is so rusty that I barely remember the _quadratic equation_:
$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
