        <strong>Designers:</strong> There are about <strong>50,000</strong> Markdown Here users, and it's likely that a lot of them will need design work in the future. Submitting a design could be <strong>good for you</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        <strong>Everyone:</strong> In about a month you'll get to vote on the new designs!

      Some users suggested that they would like a new logo, so I linked to a poll in the previous release (v2.11.4) asking people to vote on the matter. And... a clear majority think it's time for a new logo! (Thanks to everyone who voted, by the way. I read all of your comments.)
    </p>
    <p>
     So now I'm going to gather submissions and set up a voting structure, which I'll link to in a subsequent release. So, for right now, it's the design people I need the most. In about a month (early May), when it's time to vote, I'll need everyone else as well.
   </p>
   <p>
     To submit your logo(s), please email me at <a href="mailto:pritchard.adam@gmail.com">pritchard.adam@gmail.com</a> or post to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/markdown-here">Markdown Here Google Group</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Requirements/guidelines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can submit <strong>up to three designs</strong>. (I guess? I don't know. Submit more if you want, but rank them or something. If there are too many overall I'll have to cut some. But there probably won't be too many.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Submit a <strong>16x16</strong> version and a <strong>512x512</strong> version in PNG format. (They can be simply different sizes of the same image, but often the smaller needs to be simpler than the large.)
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'll need a wider array of sizes from the winner, of course. See the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/tree/master/src/common/images">current logo sizes</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You need to be willing to accept the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/blob/master/CLA-individual.md">Contributor License Agreement</a>. (It's not really that onerous. Non-exclusive perpetual license, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't worry about the existing purple-and-pink palette. The MDH site and options page can be changed to fit the new logo.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm vetoing the standard Markdown logo (which I'm not even going to link to). Too generic. Variations on it are okay, but original work, please!

    Comments from the voting that might he helpful to designers:

    <ul>
      <li>
        “Something that blends in more with the browser would be nice. Just like chromecast logo.”
        <ul>
          <li>Note: In principle, the toolbar button icon can be different than the full logo. Like, fewer colours, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “And any logo should be provided with transparency. Logo and white background looks terrible on Chrome on OSX Yosemite.”
        <ul>
          <li>Tatiana and I added the background so that the toolbar button would be visible even when used on black browser themes. But… maybe we can just ignore the browser theming problem.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “I personally think you should move to a logo that looks more ‘current’ - clean, sans-serif typography, a flat-ish design, and remove rounded corners in favour of sharper edges.” (…provides <a href="http://www.thedesignpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/flat-620x330.png">example link</a>). “There’s no reason you can’t keep a butterfly :) Finally I also feel the colour palette would be improved if the purples were kept more as an accent than as a base colour. Something greyer would keep things a little less jarring when the MD here stuff pops up!”
      </li>
      <li>
        “A simpler icon so that its clearly recognizable in smaller sizes would be an improvement.”
        <ul>
          <li>Variations on this were common.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “I like the idea, if the new logo is somewhat related I would go for it., Or at least a small change like removing the white background”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I would be fine with the current one if the box was removed from around the edge to display on the toolbar.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I’d prefer it if it fit the style of other chrome buttons.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I would prefer more square and ‘M-like’ logo. Not as curly and purple as the old one. Black and green seem to be the markdown color when going through google.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I like it generally, it’s cute/attractive :D But I feel like there could be a logo more semantically related to the product? Thinking about it, is the butterfly supposed to be an M? Maybe we could emphasize that a little more?”
        <ul>
          <li>Yes! The butterfly’s shape <em>is</em> supposed to evoke a “M”. It’s pretty loose, though.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “The rationale behind it is solid (and meaningful), so my vote should read: ‘I am interested in seeing other similarly-meaningful logos’.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I don’t find the current logo very explicit about what the plugin is actually doing.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I’m not sure what it’s meant to symbolize. I’m a new user, but I continue to forget what extension it represents… Of course, I just read the story and it makes more sense. I didn’t immediately recognize it as a butterfly. Perhaps it’s a bit too abstract?”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I don’t give too much thought to logos, but this one does grate on me when I see it. It needs a change, if only for marketing purposes. The style is well out of date”
      </li>
      <li>
        “I like the concept of the butterfly and the transformation of something “mundane” to something “beautiful”. I think I’d like to see a new attempt at a logo that includes the butterfly concept.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “The current one is too complicated. in a form a small icon, it is hard to tell all the details, just look strange. Should use something looking bold and color should be bright.”
        <ul>
          <li>This is pretty much the only suggestion for bold and bright. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “It reminds me of a hybrid person-butterfly with a tail.”
        <ul>
          <li>Rad.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
