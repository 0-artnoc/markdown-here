        <strong>Designers:</strong> There are about <strong>50,000</strong> Markdown Here users, and it's likely that a lot of them will need design work in the future. Submitting a design could be <strong>good for you</strong>.

        <strong>Everyone:</strong> In about a month you'll get to vote on the new designs!

      Some users suggested that they would like a new logo, so I linked to a poll in the previous release (v2.11.4) asking people to vote on the matter. And... a clear majority think it's time for a new logo! (Thanks to everyone who voted, by the way. I read all of your comments.)
    </p>
    <p>
     So now I'm going to gather submissions and set up a voting structure, which I'll link to in a subsequent release. So, for right now, it's the design people I need the most. In about a month (early May), when it's time to vote, I'll need everyone else as well.
   </p>
   <p>
     To submit your logo(s), please email me at <a href="mailto:pritchard.adam@gmail.com">pritchard.adam@gmail.com</a> or post to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/markdown-here">Markdown Here Google Group</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Requirements/guidelines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can submit <strong>up to three designs</strong>. (I guess? I don't know. Submit more if you want, but rank them or something. If there are too many overall I'll have to cut some. But there probably won't be too many.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Submit a <strong>16x16</strong> version and a <strong>512x512</strong> version in PNG format. (They can be simply different sizes of the same image, but often the smaller needs to be simpler than the large.)
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'll need a wider array of sizes from the winner, of course. See the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/tree/master/src/common/images">current logo sizes</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You need to be willing to accept the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/blob/master/CLA-individual.md">Contributor License Agreement</a>. (It's not really that onerous. Non-exclusive perpetual license, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't worry about the existing purple-and-pink palette. The MDH site and options page can be changed to fit the new logo.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm vetoing the standard Markdown logo (which I'm not even going to link to). Too generic. Variations on it are okay, but original work, please!
        </li>
