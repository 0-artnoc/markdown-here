      <strong>Until now, formatting your email has been a hassle.</strong> If you're writing an email of any length and complexity, you've found yourself constantly fiddling around: selecting text, clicking formatting buttons, and then fiddling some more to get it right. This is tedious, frustrating, and slow.

      Sound familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Markdown Here</b> allows you to <strong>write complex email in simple text</strong>, never taking your hands off the keyboard. When you're finished, <strong>just one click</strong> of your mouse will make your email <strong>ready to send</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You write you email in something called "Markdown", which is... <strong>so simple</strong> that it's almost not worth describing. If you've ever used <strong>asterisks and dashes and spaces</strong> to add emphasis and structure to your email, then <strong>you already use it</strong>.
